## Description

_I created a fictitious webpage for scheduling a bike repair appointment to practice implementing jQuery and understanding how to organize by seperating user interface and business logic. On the webpage you will find a form asking for basic infomation such as name, descripton, date, and start/end times. After the user submits the form, the page will refresh and direct them to a new page displaying: "Booking Succesfull!" as well as a brief summary of their submission request._
